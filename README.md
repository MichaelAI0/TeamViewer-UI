Hi, I'm MichaelAI0, a junior developer looking to gain experience and improve my skills. This project is one of my first group projects where we were tasked to create something on our own to learn more about using Angular and the Rails api.

## Purpose

I wanted to create something that would challenge me and help me develop my skills as a developer. While also highlighting my interest for web design and innovative web apps.

## Technology Used

This project was built using Angular/Typescript frontend with a Ruby on Rails backend. This includes custom controllers and user validations, following the restful api methdology. 

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you'll need to Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

here is a link to the rails api backend :
[TeamViewer-API](https://github.com/MichaelAI0/TeamViewerBackend) 
You'll need to run `rails s` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`. 

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.

## Contributions

As a junior developer, I'm always looking for feedback and ways to improve my skills. If you have any suggestions or improvements for this project, please feel free to fork off of the project.
